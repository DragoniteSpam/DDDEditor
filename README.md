# DDD Editor
Game data editor to go along with [DoOrDieDragonite](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/PokemonDoOrDie).

The plan is to create a fuly-featured game editor that will be able to handle all of the information that the main game stores externally, such as maps, monster data, item data, and probably a bunch of other stuff. The map editor portion is going to take priority for the time being though.
