Autotiles

start with hard-coded sprites, and then

Loading Assets

Loading meshes/images/audio should stay in the Data menu to make them harder to accidentally modify

Loadable Assets

 - Meshes (global)
 - Tilesets (per map)
 - autotiles (per map)
 - particle graphics (global)
 - audio (global)
 - npc images (global)
 - monster images (global)

Game Maker texture pages can go up to 8192x8192, although i'd rather not because those will decompress
	to up to 250 mb each (the 4192x4192 texture pages will only be 67 mb, 

Map Texture (1) - local

created when a new map is entered - perhaps these should be cached in temporary storage if computing
	this takes a long time

tileset images should not be more than 2048x2048 (25% of each map's 4096x4096 texture)
autotiles should not be more than sixteen 1024x256 (2048x2048 total, 25% of map's texture)
50% of map's texture still remains - you COULD have up to 48 autotiles to fill the space but that
	seems excessive and if there are other map-specific graphics they would go there anyway

Global Texture (2) - global

particles and other graphics may take up half of it: up to 2048 64x64 particle graphics would take
	up 4096x2048, which sounds like a lot, except animated particles can add up quickly so it
	may fill up faster than you expect

NPC Texture (3) - global

npcs should probably not be more than 256x256, so you could fit up to 256 of them on the NPC texture
	page, which sounds like a lot except something tells me it might not be too hard to push the
	limit

Followers Texture (4) - global

because there are probably goign to be a lot of these, they also get their own texture page. because
	there are probably going to be a lot of them, subject them to more rigorous size constraints.
	64x128 ought to do it (they're normally composed of 6 32x32 images). you can fit 2048 of these
	on a texture page.

Serialization

game data itself should probably stored in a way similar to bird game, though maybe not in ds_map strings,
	since those can take up a lot of space and presumably take a long time to decode. maps and the
	global game data will need to be stored separately but might as well follow the same format

Header

size	contents	purpose

3	0x44 * 3	"DDD," so you know what it is more or less
4	uint		version number
4	uint		number of things
4*n	uint		type of thing

Things: resources

0x00000000 (0)		Game/Map	Error, probably? basically null
0x00000001 (1)		Game		Meshes - reference - in case you want to have the vra in included files
						add a global option for this
0x00000002 (2)		Game		Meshes - self-contained - in case you want to embed the meshes in the data file
						and possibly exclude some information that's only useful to the editor?
0x00000003 (3)		Map		Tileset - metadata
0x00000004 (4)		Map		Tileset - base texture only - surface to buffer
0x00000005 (5)		Map		Tileset - autotiles only - surface to buffer
0x00000006 (6)		Map		Tileset - everything - surface to buffer
						probably more efficient if you have a dense graphics set and don't want
						the game to re-compute the map texture every time it loads up
0x00000007 (7)		Game		Particles - individual images only
0x00000008 (8)		Game		Global full texture
0x00000009 (9)		Game		NPCs - individual images only
0x0000000A (10)		Game		NPC full texture
0x0000000B (11)		Game		Followers - individual images only
0x0000000C (12)		Game		Followers full texture
0x0000000D (13)		Game		Misc graphics - individual
						you MAY need more than one page of these, depending, so make sure you
						can add more than one to the game without breaking everything
0x0000000E (14)		Game		Misc graphics full texture
0x0000000F (15)		Game		UI graphics - individual
0x00000010 (16)		Game		UI graphics full texture
0x00000011 (17)		Game		Audio - SE - references
0x00000012 (18)		Game		Audio - SE - buffers
						Not sure if embedding the uncompressed sounds as buffers will work but
						might as well try
0x00000013 (19)		Game		Audio - BGM - references
						These are going to be huge, don't bother trying to embed

Things: game data

0x00000100 (256)	Game		Another error probably?
0x00000101 (257)	Game		Items, monsters, classes, etc; there MAY be other types of assets like icons or
						sound effects for menus and stuff

Things: misc

0x00001000 (4096)	Game		Error
0x00001001 (4097)	Game		Map metadata - individual maps won't be stored because of size concerns (GMS1 is
						32-bit) and, in any case, I wrote the editor so that it can only keep track
						of one at a time
0x00001002 (4098)	Map		The contents of the maps - this will probably be most of the map files
0x00001003 (4099)	Game		Global game data, probably stuff like the title screen and credits screen and stuff
0x00001004 (4100)	Game		UI and menus and stuff, will probably refer a lot to the asset sections

Entities

finish up their properties and editor's UI for accessing those properties

modifications like move as group, group edit

add the create-by-painting effect: an orthographic camera would be really useful for this
